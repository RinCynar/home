Hi.I’m [D.K.O. Rin aGmua Cynar], </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Stubbornness and rebellion are my main colors. I don’t like collectivism, I don’t like to trivialize big things, and I don’t like the constraints of rules and regulations. For this reason, I often bear the consequences of taking risks, but I will continue to take risks. Maybe one day the consequences will exceed my ability to bear, then I am happy to have an adventurous life.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Everything you enjoy is worth it”</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Maybe I dabble in everything, but I’m not good at anything. But it doesn’t matter. Life is only a few decades long, so it doesn’t matter if I make a big mistake.</br>
